The range of our work is wide, from formulating the laws and regulations which govern the behaviour of investment bankers and traders, to creating favourable conditions for innovative companies to raise capital and succeed in the UK. One of our most immediate objectives is to implement reforms to our financial services regulations to support the government’s growth mission. This involves us doing policy work to identify and prepare improvements to the rules that the UK has inherited from the EU, as well as working with teams across HMT, government and the regulators to identify and deliver ambitious new policy proposals that will help foster growth and innovation.

SAM is a team where you will be encouraged to develop and thrive. We are advertising for two range Es/Grade 7s to head clearing and derivatives policy in the Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) branch, and to head secondary markets policy in the Capital Markets branch. The Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) branch are a friendly and encouraging branch of 6 people (1 E2 (Grade 6), 2 Es (Grade 7) and 2-3 HEO/SEO). FMIs are often described as the ‘plumbing’ of the financial system – without them, most transactions that take place across financial markets couldn’t happen. The Capital Markets branch is a friendly and encouraging team of 9 people (1 E2 (Grade 6), 2 E (Grade 7) and 6 HEO/SEO). The main focus of the branch is continuing the work to develop new regulation for UK’s wholesale capital markets post-Brexit, supporting UK competitiveness by ensuring that regulation is suitably adapted for the UK markets. Specific responsibilities in this role may include: [In the FMI branch] Leading policy development in relation to clearing houses and wider derivative markets, with the support of 1-2 range SEO/HEOs. Clearing houses, or “CCPs”, sit in the middle of market transactions, ensuring that the default of an individual firms does not translate into a wider market collapse. CCPs played a vital role during the 2008 Financial crisis and have been firmly in the spotlight ever since, with a global move over the last decade to mandate the use of CCPs in order to improve market transparency and stability. London is a market leader in this space, with two of our three CCPs considered globally systemic. The postholder would be expected to work closely with the Bank of England to deliver the UK’s new regulatory regime for CCPs post EU exit, as well as leading on other reforms to help support stability, innovation and growth in financial markets. [In the Capital Markets branch] Leading all policy related to the trading of financial instruments in the UK. With the support of 2 range SEO/HEOs, the postholder will in particular be responsible for delivering the last elements of the legislative implementation of the Wholesale Markets Review, including specific legislation related to Over-The-Counter commodity derivative markets, as well as working with the Financial Conduct Authority to continue deleting and replacing the EU-inherited ‘Markets in Financial Instruments Directive’ framework to better suit UK markets. The work in the team therefore combines an exciting focus on the technical detail of financial regulation, with UK competitiveness and financial stability.

About the Job These roles are stretching, intellectually demanding and will give the successful candidates a high level of management and policy responsibility; and the opportunity to develop a specific policy expertise.

We’re looking for people who are curious to know ‘why’ something is or isn’t working, can build the coalitions and partnerships with people to find out and are data-driven storytellers able to communicate clearly what they do find. You'll be willing to try new approaches, be a creative thinker and unafraid to speak truth to power. The DU's measure of success is other teams achieving results: we don't seek the limelight but support SoS and teams to get the best for the people the department serves. You’ll be focused on one of SoS’s top priorities, working closely with the policy and delivery teams responsible for that area to achieve results. Some of what we’ve done so far is advise SoS on the best way to tackle investor approaches to invest in our sectors, support OLS and RIO to think about ‘impact metrics’ for how they show real-world change from their policies, and going out to understand how local authorities and councils think about digital inclusion delivery on the ground and what works, to support delivery of the Digital Inclusion Action Plan. If you've got previous experience from an area of DSIT's work - whether consultancy, real-world digital delivery, delivering for citizens perhaps in the third sector, investment into tech, or experience of growing companies, or lived experience of what we could do better with unlocked data assets, we'd love to hear from you.","Key responsibilities We're looking for someone who can communicate insights in an engaging way, to support teams and senior audiences to decide what to do next and how delivery is really working to understand how we’re doing and bring it to life. We want to help teams to connect policy and programmes to real-world impact on people's lives. You’ll think about delivery with a fresh perspective, bringing energy and drive. You’ll need to structure ambiguous problems and help solve them, generate clear takeaways from complex information and make recommendations based on what the data tells us. You’ll need to motivate a diverse range of teams to work with you to act, building trust-based relationships to support your ability to make impact. A strong communicator, able to communicate with clarity, conviction and impact to a range of audiences. You’ll need to motivate a diverse range of teams to work with you to act, building trust-based relationships to support your ability to make impact and deploying soft skills, pragmatism and the ability to compromise. You’ll communicate confidently and in a structured way with people inside and outside the organisation and be collaborative by default. You'll be able to use data to illustrate stories or answer hypotheses, you might be conducting fieldwork and speaking to people with lived experience of delivering policies or programmes, unblocking problems and suggesting ways forward on issues, or stress-testing delivery plans so we know what we're trying to achieve, how we're trying to achieve it, and how we'll know when we've got there. You’ll support Ministers with delivery meetings, helping them understand risk on that priority. You’ll be a problem-solver, and fixer, working closely with SpAds. We tailor our support to teams based on what they need and what SoS wants to achieve, but we provide an independent perspective. Essential criteria A strong communicator, able to communicate with clarity, conviction and impact to a range of audiences. A coalition-builder, proven ability to quickly build relationships with a diverse set of teams and working collaboratively, who draws satisfaction from seeing others succeed and can bring people with you. Demonstrably strong analytical skill set, able to turn evidence into meaningful insights, bring data to life, identify gaps and support going after these. A team player who adds value and who understands how to drive delivery through others and across an organisation without ownership and who enjoys collaboration. Desirable criteria Some understanding of DSIT's sectors, policies or programmes, particularly digital delivery or use of data.

Please note that this role requires SC clearance, which would normally need 5 years’ UK residency in the past 5 years. This is not an absolute requirement, but supplementary checks may be needed where individuals have not lived in the UK for that period. This may mean your security clearance (and therefore your appointment) will take longer or, in some cases, not be possible. For meaningful checks to be carried out, you will need to have lived in the UK for a sufficient period of time, to enable appropriate checks to be carried out and produce a result which provides the required level of assurance.

Other information In January 2025, it was announced that the Government Digital Service (GDS) will move to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) as a part of a machinery of government change. This change aims to bring together the digital transformation of public services into one central department, presenting exciting opportunities and positioning DSIT to lead the government’s digital agenda. This role is in scope to transfer to DSIT when the machinery of government change takes place. As a result, if you are successful and appointed by Cabinet Office to this role before 1st June 2025, your role will transfer from Cabinet Office to DSIT at the time of the relevant machinery of government change taking place. If your start date is after 1 June 2025, you will be appointed direct to DSIT and your appointment will be unaffected by the machinery of government change. We are currently consulting with our Trade Unions on which policies, terms and conditions will apply on transfer. The statement of changes applied to all other Cabinet Office staff will also apply to you if you are successful. We encourage you to apply and look forward to reviewing your application.

Unless stated otherwise in the advert, your CV will not form part of the assessment but will be used for information purposes and only shared with the panel at interview stage. Our application system is designed to remove as much bias as possible from the recruitment system – this means that a hiring manager does not know your name, your details, see your whole application in one go (or have your CV at review stage unless stated otherwise). Your answers are randomised and chunked up. This means that each assessor views sets of responses to questions, for example all candidates’ responses to ‘Seeing the Big Picture’ rather than seeing a candidate’s full application. The science behind this is that recruitment can be subject to ordering and fatigue effects and we want to reduce this as much as possible. Most of our campaigns utilise multiple assessors and so it is possible that each of your answers would be viewed by different assessors. When writing your application, remember: The assessor won’t be reading your answers sequentially. Do not assume that the same assessors will have read all of your answers. If talking about something in your first answer, make sure that you write the second answer as if you had not written the first (and so on!)

Our work includes: Developing and drafting legislation Providing legal advice on policies Securing our economic and trade relationships Ensuring value from commercial contracts worth billions of pounds Providing the Civil Service’s employment law advice We are at the heart of delivering the Government’s priorities and our success depends on our people. GLD is a non-ministerial government department, sponsored by the Attorney General. We are headed by the Treasury Solicitor, our Permanent Secretary and employ nearly 3000 people, including over 2000 legal professionals. Our offices include London, Leeds, Bristol, Croydon and Manchester as well as overseas. We provide specialist legal services including Litigation, Employment and Commercial Law as well as advising most Government Departments on the policies and services they deliver. GLD also depends on a range of vital corporate services. These are essential to the smooth and efficient running of the Department and provide the foundation to enable GLD to deliver outstanding legal services. Our corporate functions include Strategy, HR, Finance, Digital, Data and Technology, Communications, Security, Commercial and Project delivery. Our vision is to be an outstanding legal organisation and a brilliant place to work where everyone can thrive and fulfil their potential. This is an exciting time for GLD, with cutting edge legal work on global issues and a transformation agenda which is ensuring the Department exemplifies the Modern Civil Service. To find out more about what we do visit the Government Legal Department’s webpage or have a look at this short film which showcases the breadth of work government lawyers and legal trainees are involved in.","About the Panel Services Management Team, Legal Operations Directorate The Panel Services Management (PSM) Team sits within the Legal Delivery team of GLD’s Legal Operations Directorate. It supports GLD and its central Government clients in their use of private sector law firms to supplement the work of GLD across its commercial, employment, advisory and litigation divisions. GLD and its client Departments use the legal panels set up by Crown Commercial Service when they require legal services that cannot be delivered by GLD alone. The largest and most frequently used of these panels is the RM6179 Legal Services Panel (LSP), which provides access to 17 law firms providing (i) general legal services and (ii) finance and complex legal services. Where GLD or its clients require additional work from a law firm, they select the firm and enter into individual call off contracts with the selected firm. All 17 firms are considered “strategic suppliers” due to their importance to supporting GLD with their legal advice to Government. The PSM Team perform two key functions to support GLD in its use of these strategic suppliers: Relationship management at panel level – acting as the key liaison point between GLD, client Departments and the firms to facilitate them in engaging more collaboratively to improve delivery of government objectives and increase mutual value beyond that originally contracted Call off contract management – set up and ongoing management of call off contracts under these panels Members of the team support Departments in sourcing the correct law firm for each project and manage legal contracts for key departmental priorities and high-profile litigation, working alongside our lawyers to ensure that excellent legal services are provided by our firms as and when they are needed. Both elements of the PSM team work closely together to deliver a professional service to our GLD lawyers and their client Departments to allow them to focus on their legal work and ensure that the panel and the call offs are managed in line with best practice in procurement and contract management. The call off contract management team currently provide a full service to GLD’s Commercial Law Group, and a lighter touch service support to other areas of GLD. The team supports teams from all GLD offices and individuals may be based in any of these offices, and all work flexibly. The team is critical in ensuring that GLD and Government uses the law firm panels effectively and appropriately. The Role We are recruiting a contract officer to lead on managing the invoice payment process for the call off contracts with panel law firms so that we can ensure we meet our contractual requirement to pay invoices within 30 days. We are seeking applications from individuals with an interest in progressing a career in contract management, procurement or finance. The role provides an exciting springboard to these careers, offering the successful candidates good experience in contract administration and management, an understanding of contract and departmental finance management, and provides an introduction into public procurement. This is a fantastic opportunity to work collaboratively with other team members, people in multiple Government departments, GLD lawyers and external panel law firms. We are looking for a self-motivated team player, with the ability to prioritise your workload and be able to deliver a good quality service at pace. Your workload will involve sending and receiving numerous emails daily, advising departments on the accuracy of invoices and their spend information. You will be expected to proactively manage correspondence whilst tracking spend against budgets and updating Excel spreadsheets with financial information. The successful candidate should be able to communicate confidently and effectively with a wide range of stakeholders and be confident in working collaboratively within the PSM Team. Key Responsibilities: Leading on managing the invoice payment process for supplier contracts, working to deadlines to arrange payment within the Government’s contractual 30-day payment timescales. Reviewing invoices for errors (e.g. wrong rate applied, wrong reference numbers) and ensuring that the invoices are approved for payment. Where errors or queries arise, raising these with the supplier and escalating any disputes as appropriate, and as quickly as possible. Proactively manage the GLD and Department stakeholders to ensure that invoices are approved within agreed timescales and payment is made as soon as possible within the 30-day payment period. Effectively monitor the contracts you are responsible for to make sure that suppliers send in work-in-progress reports and/or invoice regularly so that there are no surprises. Accurately update the PSM team’s contract management Excel spreadsheets and save the necessary documents in a timely manner. Highlight key issues to contract managers (e.g. where spend looks like it may exceed budgets), and work with them to ensure effective contract management across a portfolio of work for one or more Department. Develop and maintain good working relationships with positive collaborative relationships within the PSM and with key internal stakeholders e.g. GLD deputy directors, GLD lawyers, GLD accounts payable, budget holders and external stakeholders. Manage the PSM team group email inboxes, resolving routine queries daily and escalating more complex queries to senior members of the team In time, where the opportunity arises, working in partnership with contract managers to support them with contract management beyond having ownership of invoicing We are keen to ensure that successful candidates have access to a career path within the Civil Service and in particular with commercial and contract management roles. Therefore, we are aligning these roles to those at “Commercial Support” standard as set out in the Government Commercial Function People Standards for the Profession (GCF).","Behaviours- Essential Below are details of the Success Profiles that make up this role.

Unless stated otherwise in the advert, your CV will not form part of the assessment but will be used for information purposes and only shared with the panel at interview stage. Our application system is designed to remove as much bias as possible from the recruitment system – this means that a hiring manager does not know your name, your details, see your whole application in one go (or have your CV at review stage unless stated otherwise). Your answers are randomised and chunked up.

The science behind this is that recruitment can be subject to ordering and fatigue effects and we want to reduce this as much as possible. Most of our campaigns utilise multiple assessors and so it is possible that each of your answers would be viewed by different assessors. When writing your application, remember: The assessor won’t be reading your answers sequentially. Do not assume that the same assessors will have read all of your answers.

This is vital to understanding how the resources are being used, support the continuous learning and understand the economic impact. The team’s aim is to fulfil the ambition reflected in the National Audit Office (NAO) review of Exports, which highlighted DBT’s digital services did not yet provide the export support that some businesses needed.

Our work includes: Developing and drafting legislation Providing legal advice on policies Securing our economic and trade relationships Ensuring value from commercial contracts worth billions of pounds Providing the Civil Service’s employment law advice We are at the heart of delivering the Government’s priorities and our success depends on our people. GLD is a non-ministerial government department, sponsored by the Attorney General. We are headed by the Treasury Solicitor, our Permanent Secretary and employ nearly 3000 people, including over 2000 legal professionals. Our offices include London, Leeds, Bristol, Croydon and Manchester as well as overseas. We provide specialist legal services including Litigation, Employment and Commercial Law as well as advising most Government Departments on the policies and services they deliver. GLD also depends on a range of vital corporate services. These are essential to the smooth and efficient running of the Department and provide the foundation to enable GLD to deliver outstanding legal services. Our corporate functions include Strategy, HR, Finance, Digital, Data and Technology, Communications, Security, Commercial and Project delivery. Our vision is to be an outstanding legal organisation and a brilliant place to work where everyone can thrive and fulfil their potential. This is an exciting time for GLD, with cutting edge legal work on global issues and a transformation agenda which is ensuring the Department exemplifies the Modern Civil Service. To find out more about what we do visit the Government Legal Department’s webpage or have a look at this short film which showcases the breadth of work government lawyers and legal trainees are involved in.","Welcome from Adrian Roberts, Legal Director (International Trade) International trade law is crucial for UK growth, global prosperity, and harmonious international relations. In this role, you will be joining a team of exceptional lawyers, in terms of collegiality, expertise and professionalism, doing a unique and important job. Since I joined the Government Legal Profession (GLP) 23 years ago from the self-employed bar, I have never looked back: the breadth and depth of legal work covered in the GLP is amazing, whether you are negotiating and drafting treaties, advising ministers, literally making new law, or running litigation in the national or international courts. Now is an especially interesting time (!) but throughout your career you will often be doing the law that other people read about in the news. That’s why we are investing in GLP’s Trade Law Profession, by rolling out the GLP’s Trade Law Career Pathway. This will ensure (1) clear professional development opportunities, and (2) that His Majesty’s Government has the right expertise to deliver for the citizens of the UK. Good luck! The advertised roles will be across GLD Advisory Trade Law teams. GLD has approximately 200 Advisory Trade Lawyers in the legal divisions of: Department for Business and Trade (DBT) HM Treasury (HMT) Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) and Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT) Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) Cabinet Office Department for Transport (DfT) Home Office Department for Health & Social Care (DHSC) Department for Education Should you be successful you will be matched to a role within one of the teams outlined, based on your CV and business needs. It’s also important to note that you’ll be a part of a wider network of Government Legal Profession (GLP) Trade Lawyers. There are government trade lawyers housed in the Attorney General’s Office (AGO), Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), Trade Remedies Authority (TRA), and the UK’s Missions to the European Union and to the World Trade Organization (WTO) (UKMis Brussels and Geneva respectively). In gist, there is a complex ecosystem of lawyers advising on international trade matters across GLD and the wider GLP. This mirrors a complex ecosystem of interrelated policy and operational responsibilities across government. The Role It is important to emphasise that all GLD Advisory Trade Lawyers are expected to advise on both Trade Law and Public Law, as government lawyers. The mix will vary from role to role. Trade Law Advice There are broadly four areas that GLD Trade Lawyers advise on and engage in: policy development. E.g. advising on the international and domestic legal requirements for, and risks of, proposed UK government policies; negotiation and implementation of international agreements; dispute resolution in international and domestic forums; and corporate support. Case study: Negotiation of international agreements Several government lawyers will form part of the negotiating team for a free trade agreement (FTA). Many more government lawyers will be involved in providing legal advice that supports the development of the negotiated text. DBT leads on a number of chapters – for example, in relation to goods, services, intellectual property, sustainability and disputes. HMT leads on financial services, HMRC on customs and trade, Defra on Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS). Each chapter has a ‘chapter lead lawyer’ who advises the chapter policy lead. Legal input to stand-alone agreements on trading arrangements also flows from lead policy responsibility, e.g. HMRC Legal leads on negotiation of agreements on customs and borders. Public Law Advice As a Grade 6 lawyer in a GLD Advisory division, you will also be expected to advise on public law (in addition to trade law). GLD advisory lawyers are relied on to bring to life policies for which Ministers are accountable to Parliament and the electorate. The legal issues are often complex, novel and politically sensitive. The legal approach may be scrutinised by Parliament, the media, courts, and other institutions, domestic, European and International. Advisory lawyers think through all the legal implications of a policy, for instance human rights, International law, equality and data protection issues, as well as core public law principles. They need to anticipate possible legal challenges and provide officials and Ministers with clear legal risk assessments. Where new primary legislation is required, advisory lawyers work with Parliamentary Counsel on the draft Bill and support policy colleagues and Ministers at all stages of the parliamentary process. Advisory lawyers also implement policy reforms and Acts of Parliament by drafting a huge volume of secondary legislation. To write a new law is a special privilege, requiring both precision of expression and creativity. It is a team effort involving multiple checks, but the drafter will always have a special sense of pride and ownership.

One of the functions of the RII team is to establish strategic awareness of product-related harms to support OPSS’ work. Risk can be affected by several drivers, for example social, economic or technological factors. We want to explore harnessing potential signals – such as trade, raw materials pricing, technological advances and consumer attitudes, preferences and behaviours – to generate early warnings when future product risks are changing or worsening. This work will scope how we can develop a data-driven model for anticipating new or worsening risks associated with product-related harms. This project will support OPSS’ capacity to protect consumers and support businesses in being aware of, and responding to, these risks. The successful candidate will benefit from a full induction into OPSS and Department for Business and Trade. This post will offer a great opportunity to learn more about how risk-based regulation is delivered, and how His Majesty’s Government is embracing data science and innovation to drive its work to protect the public and support businesses to grow and to do the right thing for their customers. Key Responsibilities: The project will be delivered as a strand of the strategic assessment activity being planned and delivered by the RII team, and is anticipated to have four main phases: Scope whether similar anticipatory tools have been formulated for the product sector, or similar sectors, and evaluate them. Work with OPSS colleagues and others across government to identify relevant accessible datasets. Engage with experts in regulation, industry and academia to develop and share hypotheses concerning the causal factors for product-related issues. Determine the feasibility of using available data to highlight upcoming changes to product-related harms, potentially including the development of a prototype model. We would welcome the exploration of innovative approaches to achieving our objectives within this framework. The successful candidate will be expected to develop and manage a detailed project plan incorporating these four phases, and to take responsibility for providing relevant updates to project sponsors. There will also be a requirement to report on the outcomes of the fellowship to relevant stakeholders, both within OPSS and potentially externally. This role would suit an applicant motivated by harnessing the power of data science to protect the public, with experience of devising and developing predictive models. Knowledge of research around consumer and/or construction product trends and an understanding of this sector would help, as would experience in the interpretation of economic data, particularly around trade.

The UK cosmetics sector is extremely supportive of the widespread adoption of NAMs and several UK groups are internationally recognised in this area. Regulatory confidence in using NAMs is crucial to their more widespread adoption and this project could identify us as a forward thinking and collaborative department and help to cement us at the forefront of this complex, but exciting area. The aim will be to set out the framework for and undertake a chemical risk assessment of a relevant chemical using NAMs as a test case for OPSS, helping identify and procure the necessary equipment and expertise required to undertake this assessment. The ultimate aim of the fellowship will be to move towards better integration of NAMs into our risk assessment processes whilst ensuring that the high standards necessary for consumer safety are maintained and that outputs are robust and adhere to internationally recognised best practice. The Fellow will be working with the Toxicology team, as part of the OPSS Science team, but will be responsible for liaison with procurement teams, IT teams, our Scientific Advisory Group and other scientific experts, providing training and leaving a legacy of resources that can be built upon as knowledge grows in this area and instils greater confidence in using NAMs going forwards. This legacy could include, published papers, training sessions and access to resources that we do not have currently. Training will be provided for the Fellow on risk assessment methodologies and background on the use of NAMs in regulatory risk assessment. As this topic crosses several government departments, the Fellow will gain cross-Whitehall experience and will need to build their contacts through this project.

Our advisers span 12 specialisms. They work in the UK and in-country where they influence national policy and development agendas and support delivery of goals and, at regional and global levels, shape global policies.
